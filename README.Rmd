## Installing DulogsInteractions

Without uploading the Dulogs data as raw package data, installing the DulogsInteractions package is slightly more tricky. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. See this [guide](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-git/git-clone.html), for example.
2. Add the `dulogs-raw` data folder to the `DulogsInteractions` directory.
3. Open the R project corresponding to the cloned repository.
4. Run `inst/scripts/setup.R`.

You should now have `DulogsInteractions` as a library and be able to recreate the following examples. If the package is ever updated on GitHub, you will want to pull the updates (see [guide](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-git/git-pull.html), for example) and rerun `inst/scripts/setup.R`.

## DulogsInteractions Pipeline

The DulogsInteractions pipeline is seperated into three steps:

1. Reading the data with `read_dulogs`.
2. Preprocessing the data with `preprocess_dulogs`.
3. Constructing interactions with `construct_interactions`.
4. Restructuring interactions as an edgelist with `as_edgelist`.

We will start by providing a basic example of the functionality before describing each component of the pipeline in detail.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# set up logs for each function
baselog <- 'logs/vignette'

# read and combine mobile node and in range data according to the requested `time_eps`
#  and `barn_rule`
el <- read_dulogs(
  paths = c(mobilenode = 'dulogs/2022', inrange = 'dulogs/2022'),
  patterns = c(mobilenode = 'MN_DATA', inrange = 'MN_RANGE'),
  year = 2022,
  time_eps = 2,
  barn_rule = 'or',
  log = file.path(baselog, 'read_dulogs')
) %>%
  # preprocess dulog meetings to remove data oddities and filter meetings by rssi,
  #  meeting times, and whether to keep all meetings or only those in a barn. The
  #  `time_eps` is used to classify meetings as reciprocal meetings.
  preprocess_dulogs(
    .,
    min_rssi = -Inf,
    max_rssi = 15,
    start_time = '0000-01-01 UTC',
    end_time = '9999-01-01 UTC',
    only_barn = FALSE,
    time_eps = 2,
    log = file.path(baselog, 'preprocess_dulogs')
  ) %>%
  # construct interactions according to the `time_gap`. A gap of at least `time_gap`
  #  seconds between contiguous meetings necessitates a new interaction. The user
  #  also specifies whether to treat meetings as directed or undirected, and whether
  #  to remove self loops. If undirected edges are requested, reciprocal edges taking
  #  place at the same time are collapsed into one meeting.
  construct_interactions(.,
                         time_gap = 8,
                         directed = FALSE,
                         loops = FALSE,
                         log = file.path(baselog, 'construct_interactions')) %>%
  # filter the interactions according to preferences and convert to an edgelist
  as_edgelist(
    .,
    min_secs_elapsed = 4,
    max_secs_elapsed = Inf,
    min_proportion_barn = 0,
    max_proportion_barn = 1
  )

head(el)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
el <- read_dulogs(
  paths = c(mobilenode = 'dulogs/2022', inrange = 'dulogs/2022'),
  patterns = c(mobilenode = 'MN_DATA', inrange = 'MN_RANGE'),
  year = 2022,
  time_eps = 2,
  barn_rule = 'or'
) %>%
  preprocess_dulogs(
    .,
    min_rssi = -Inf,
    max_rssi = 15,
    start_time = '0000-01-01 UTC',
    end_time = '9999-01-01 UTC',
    only_barn = FALSE,
    time_eps = 2
  ) %>%
  construct_interactions(
    .,
    time_gap = 8,
    directed = FALSE,
    loops = FALSE
  ) %>%
  as_edgelist(
    .,
    min_secs_elapsed = 4,
    max_secs_elapsed = Inf,
    min_proportion_barn = 0,
    max_proportion_barn = 1
  )

head(el)
```

### Raw package data

Currently, there are two required raw package data files for this pipeline to function: `birds-raw.csv` and `timeframe-raw.csv`, each located in the `data-raw` folder. Any time these respective comma separated value files are updated, their respective R scripts (e.g. `birds.R` and `timeframe.R`) must be run. Do not edit the R scripts, simply run them.

**`birds-raw.csv`**

At the very least, this comma separated value file *must* contain columns:

* `year`: year under study, formatted as YYYY,
* `tag`: numeric value indicating the Dulog tag ID deployed in the year under study,
* `band_id`: unique 9-digit band number describing the bird.

Other columns are tag attributes which will be helpful in the analysis phase. Examples may include things like sex of the bird, mating tag, and/or other identifying information.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('rmd/pipeline_folder/birds_raw_csv.png')
```

**`timeframe-raw.csv`**

At the very least, this comma separated value file *must* contain columns:

* `year`: year under study, formatted as YYYY,
* `tz`: timezone as it appears in the [timezone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones),
* `start_year`: year when tags are turned on, formatted as YYYY,
* `start_month`: month when tags are turned on, formatted as MM,
* `start_day`: day when tags are turned on, formatted as DD,
* `start_hour`: hour (using a [24-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock)) when tags are turned on, formatted as HH,
* `end_year`: year when tags are turned off, formatted as YYYY,
* `end_month`: month when tags are turned off, formatted as MM,
* `end_day`: day when tags are turned off, formatted as DD,
* `end_hour`: hour (using a [24-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock)) when tags are turned off, formatted as HH.

```

### Reading the dulogs data

There are two sources of data: mobile node data files and in range data files. Mobile node data files record meetings between birds, logging the meeting time, sender tag, and receiver tag. The in range data files record when a bird is registered by a base station. The base stations are located in the barns, so we use these data as proxy for whether a bird is in the barn. There is imprecision in the clocks, so these files are combined using a fuzzy join on year, node, and meeting time. We deem a bird in the barn at the time of their meeting if they were registered by the base station in the in range data within `time_eps` (inclusive, either before or after) seconds of their meeting time. For example, suppose an epsilon of 2 is provided. If bird $A$ met bird $B$ at time $t$, and bird $A$ is listed in the in range data at time $t+1$ whereas bird $B$ is listed at $t+3$, then bird $A$ is deemed in the barn while bird $B$ is deemed out of the barn. Even still, if either the sender, receiver, or both birds are deemed in the barn during their meeting time, then the meeting is said to be in the barn if the barn rule is set to 'or'. The following describe each column of the resulting data frame:

* `year` (`chr`): year under study,
* `origin` (`chr`): mobile node data file containing this meeting,
* `meeting_date` (`POSIXct`): Unix timestamp for meeting, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,
* `rx_node` (`chr`): receiver tag, must be coercible to a numeric,
* `tx_node` (`chr`): sender tag, must be coercible to a numeric,
* `rssi` (`num`): signal strength for meeting, highly positive implies the birds were closer in physical proximity,
* `received date` (`POSIXct`): Unix timestamp for data retrieval, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,
* `rx_barn` (`logi`): indicator of whether the meeting time is within `time_eps` of a base station log corresponding to the receiver,
* `tx_barn` (`logi`): indicator of whether the meeting time is within `time_eps` of a base station log corresponding to the sender,
* `barn` (`logi`): indicator of whether either the sender, receiver, or both was identified in the barn at the time of meeting.

```

### Preprocessing the dulogs data

The dulog data have known limitations that we address in the preprocessing step. These issue include addressing meetings:

1. taking place outside of the specified dates under study,
2. taking place outside of the specified daily times under study,
3. involving a phantom actor (i.e. an undocumented bird),
4. which are duplicated (i.e. same timestamp, sender, receiver, and signal strength)
5. which are nearly duplicated (i.e. same timestamp, sender, receiver, but different signal strengths).

Any meeting characterized by points one through four are removed from the dulogs data (the combined mobile node and in range data files). To resolve point five, the near duplicate meeting with the smallest (i.e. most negative) signal strength is preserved, providing us with the most conservative estimate. Meetings are also removed according to user input, including any meeting:

1. with a signal strength outside the range of `min_rssi` and `max_rssi`,
2. before the `start_date` or after the `end_date`,
3. taking place outside of the barn (if `only_barn` is set to `TRUE`).

After removing meetings between birds according to the above specifications, the data are prepared the network construction step. This includes the creation of several columns which are useful for constructing interactions at the next stage according to the user's preferences (e.g., see `i_node` and `j_node` which are helpful at constructing undirected interactions). The following describe each column of the resulting data frame:

* `year` (`chr`): year under study,
* `origin` (`chr`): mobile node data file containing this meeting,
* `meeting_date` (`POSIXct`): Unix timestamp for meeting, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,
* `rx_node` (`chr`): receiver tag, must be coercible to a numeric,
* `tx_node` (`chr`): sender tag, must be coercible to a numeric,
* `rx_id` (`chr`): receiver tag description from raw package data,
* `tx_id` (`chr`): sender tag description from raw package data,
* `rx_barn` (`logi`): indicator of whether the meeting time is within `time_eps` of a base station log corresponding to the receiver,
* `tx_barn` (`logi`): indicator of whether the meeting time is within `time_eps` of a base station log corresponding to the sender,
* `rssi` (`num`): signal strength for meeting, highly positive implies the birds were closer in physical proximity,
* `barn` (`logi`): indicator of whether either the sender, receiver, or both was identified in the barn at the time of meeting.
* `i_node` (`chr`): tag with smallest sorted value, $i$, must be coercible to a numeric,
* `j_node` (`chr`): tag with largest sorted value, $j$, must be coercible to a numeric,
* `i_id` (`chr`): tag $i$ description from raw package data,
* `j_id` (`chr`): tag $j$ description from raw package data
* `i_barn` (`lgl`): indicator of whether the meeting time is within `time_eps` of a base station log corresponding to tag $i$
* `j_barn` (`lgl`): indicator of whether the meeting time is within `time_eps` of a base station log corresponding to tag $j$
* `received_date` (`POSIXct`): Unix timestamp for data retrieval, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,
* `swapped` (`lgl`): indicator of whether the values of `rx_node` and `tx_node` were swapped to create `i_node` and `j_node`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('rmd/pipeline_folder/preprocess_dulogs.png')
```

The choice of `time_eps` in the reading step will not impact the preprocessing step unless `only_barn` is set to `TRUE`. In this case, a larger `time_eps` will result in fewer meetings excluded because of the `only_barn` constraint. Assuming a `time_eps` of two, the following represents the number of meetings remaining (and removed) after each consideration of the preprocessing step when the arguments are set to the defaults (i.e. `max_rssi` of 15; all other arguments such as `min_rssi` and `only_barn` are set so not to exclude meetings):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pdulogs <- readr::read_rds('logs/vignette/preprocess_dulogs.rds')
head(pdulogs$sankey_flow, 12)
```

While not strictly necessary, the same preprocessing used to address known data limitations is conducted on the in range data during data reading step. This preprocessing and logging of the in range data is largely to document any issues with the in range data. Assuming a `time_eps` of two, the following represents the number of pulses by the base stations (in range data) remaining (and removed) at each stage of preprocessing:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dulogs <- readr::read_rds('logs/vignette/read_dulogs.rds')
head(dulogs$sankey_flow, 8)
```

For more detailed information regarding these matters, see the logging files.

### Constructing interactions from the dulogs data

Once the data are preprocessed accordingly, the next step is to construct interactions from meeting data. Interactions are composed of sequential meetings between the actors where an interaction is defined by the number of seconds between meetings. That is, if two birds meet and their next recorded meeting occurs at least `time_gap` seconds later, then the birds necessarily interacted twice. Otherwise, the birds interacted once for a longer period of time. The user should specify whether the interactions should be considered directed. If a meeting between bird $A$ (the receiver, `rx_node`) and bird $B$ (the sender, `tx_node`) should be treated differently than a meeting bird $B$ (the receiver, `rx_node`) to bird $A$ (the sender, `tx_node`), then the interactions should be directed. Furthermore, the user should specify whether loops should be retained. These are meetings where the same bird is logged as both the sender and the receiver. By default, interactions are assumed undirected and loops are excluded from consideration.

For now, the following describe each column of the resulting data frame:

* `year` (`chr`): year under study,
* `from_node` (`chr`): if directed, sender tag; otherwise, tag with smallest sorted value,
* `to_node` (`chr`): if directed, receiver tag; otherwise, tag with the largest sorted value,
* `interaction_group` (`dbl`): counter for interaction by pairs of nodes in a given year; each row is uniquely identified by year, from and to nodes, and the interaction group,
* `start_time` (`POSIXct`): Unix timestamp marking the beginning of the interaction, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,
* `end_time` (`POSIXct`): Unix timestamp marking the end of the interaction, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,
* `secs_elapsed` (`dbl`): seconds elapsed in the interaction,
* `num_meetings` (`int`): number of meetings recorded in the interaction,
* `meetings_per_sec` (`dbl`): number of meetings recorded per second in the interaction,
* `rssi_min` (`dbl`): minimum RSSI in the interaction,
* `rssi_med` (`dbl`): median RSSI in the interaction,
* `rssi_mean` (`dbl`): mean RSSI in the interaction,
* `rssi_max` (`dbl`): maximum RSSI in the interaction.

```

### Restructuring interactions as an edgelist

There may be reason to exclude interactions. For example, if the researcher is interested in only short interactions, it may be useful to filter according to the seconds elapsed. Furthermore, if the user wishes to capture interactions that largely (but perhaps not completely) take place in the barn, the user can filter according to the proportion of meetings taking place in the barn. Once the interactions have been filtered in this way, an edgelist is constructed. 

An edgelist consists of four columns: `year`, `from_node`, `to_node`, and `num_interactions`. Since Dulog tags are not unique across years, relations between birds are defined by the tuple: `year`, `from_node`, and `to_node`. The number of interactions, `num_interactions`, provides the total number of interactions (of interest) between the from and to nodes in a given year. If the interactions requested are undirected, from and to are simply nomenclature to describe the adjacent pair (where 'from' dicates the node with the smallest dulog tag number). Otherwise, if the interactions requested are directed, from and to distingush the sender node (from) from the receiver node (to). 

For now, the following describe each column of the resulting data frame:

* `year` (`chr`): year under study,
* `from_node` (`chr`): if directed, sender tag; otherwise, tag with smallest sorted value,
* `to_node` (`chr`): if directed, receiver tag; otherwise, tag with the largest sorted value,
* `num_interactions` (`int`): total number of interactions of interest (i.e. satisfying the arguments of the function).
